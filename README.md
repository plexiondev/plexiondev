## Overview

It is me, the man, the myth, the legend; plexionDEV. I create *awesome* minecraft datapacks, resourcepacks and maps along with my website and the occasional discord bot every now and then. This is basically my main place to dump what i've been working on.

My main (or secondary i dunno lol) focus is spent on my website, [plexion.dev](https://plexion.dev) - you can find all of my Minecraft stuff over there, if you're interested. For a direct link, check out the [Library](https://plexion.dev/library) page.

**I do also exist elsewhere -**
 if you're interested, my dev accounts are [PlanetMinecraft](https://planetminecraft.com/member/plexiondev), [YouTube](https://tinyurl.com/plexiondev) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/plexiondev) and my main accounts are [YouTube (plexion)](https://youtube.com/plexion), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/plexionlive) & [Twitch (plexionLIVE)](https://twitch.tv/plexionLIVE)

## Licensing n stuff

I'm pretty relaxed with licensing and all that stuff, but for short: any project or resource found under the plexion.dev domain is protected under the [GNU GPL v3](https://github.com/plexiondev/plexiondev.github.io/blob/master/LICENSE) license. I also have seperate guidelines for my content that doesn't follow a set license, [here](https://plexion.dev/terms).
