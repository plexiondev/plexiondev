## Overview

It is me, the man, the myth, the legend; plexionDEV. I create *awesome* minecraft datapacks, resourcepacks and maps along with my website and the occasional discord bot every now and then. This is basically my main place to dump what i've been working on.

My main focus is spent on my website, [plexion.dev](https://plexion.dev) - you can find all of my Minecraft stuff over there in the [project library](https://plexion.dev/library)

**I do also exist elsewhere -**
 if you're interested, my dev accounts are [PlanetMinecraft](https://planetminecraft.com/member/plexiondev), [YouTube](https://tinyurl.com/plexiondev) and my main accounts are [YouTube (plexion)](https://youtube.com/plexion), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/plexionlive) & [Twitch (plexionLIVE)](https://twitch.tv/plexionLIVE)
